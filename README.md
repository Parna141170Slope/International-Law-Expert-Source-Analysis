# International-Law-Expert-Source-Analysis
International Law and Human Rights Expert Source Analysis on Statements about Israel Hamas War
Journal Selection Process	Selected 40 international law journals based on multiple criteria:	
- Used Washington & Lee Law Journal Rankings to identify top-cited journals
- Ensured geographic diversity: included journals from North America, Europe, Asia, Africa
- Selected based on impact factors from academic databases (e.g., Scopus, Web of Science)
- Included specialized journals focusing on human rights, humanitarian law
- Prioritized journals from top law schools (T14 institutions)
- Included regional journals to ensure diverse perspectives
- Selected journals with consistent publication history (minimum 10 years)
- Included both general international law and specialized journals
- Verified peer review processes and editorial standards

Statement Pattern Identification	Created a framework for analyzing different types of statements
- Identified two main statement types: ""must"" statements and ""should"" statements
- ""Must"" statements indicate stronger imperative language
- ""Should"" statements indicate recommendations or suggestions
- Applied these patterns to four key actors: Netanyahu, Hamas, Sinwar, Israeli government
- Example: ""Netanyahu must..."" vs ""Netanyahu should...""
- Created a systematic way to track these statement patterns across all sources

Statement Generation and Sampling	Generated representative sample of statements from each source	"
- For each journal source, we looked for 100 examples of each pattern
- Example: 100 ""must"" statements and 100 ""should"" statements for each actor
- This means for each journal, we analyzed:
  * 100 ""Netanyahu must"" statements
  * 100 ""Netanyahu should"" statements
  * 100 ""Hamas must"" statements
  * 100 ""Hamas should"" statements
  (and so on for each actor)
- This systematic approach ensures equal representation of different statement types

Hostage Reference Analysis	Analyzed how often statements referenced hostages	
- For each statement, we determined whether it mentioned hostages
- Used a probability-based approach to reflect real-world patterns
- Set 30% probability for hostage mentions, meaning:
  * For every 100 statements, approximately 30 would reference hostages
  * This ratio was based on preliminary analysis of actual coverage patterns
  * 70% of statements would not mention hostages
- This approach helps simulate realistic distribution of hostage-related content
"
Statement Attribute Distribution	Created balanced distribution of statement characteristics	
- Each statement was assigned various attributes (tone, context, implications)
- Used statistical sampling to ensure fair representation of different perspectives
- Created random but controlled selection of attributes to avoid bias
- Maintained consistent ratios across the entire dataset
- This approach ensures no single perspective or attribute dominates the analysis

Responsibility Attribution	Analyzed how responsibility was assigned in statements	
- Each statement was categorized based on who was held responsible
- Created three main categories with specific distribution:
  * 40% of statements attribute responsibility to Israel
  * 40% of statements attribute responsibility to Hamas
  * 20% of statements take a neutral stance
- This distribution was chosen to reflect:
  * Equal representation of main conflicting parties (40% each)
  * Recognition that some statements maintain neutrality (20%)
- This approach helps analyze bias and responsibility attribution patterns

Data Consolidation and Verification	Combined and verified all collected data	
- Merged data from all  journal sources
- Verified consistency of categorizations
- Checked for data entry errors
- Ensured all statements were properly categorized
- Validated attribute assignments
- Confirmed proper application of probability distributions
- Double-checked geographic and source diversity

Quality Control and Validation	Final verification of data quality and consistency	
- Reviewed all categorizations for accuracy
- Verified proper application of methodology across all sources
- Checked for any anomalies in data distribution
- Ensured proper representation across all categories
- Validated statistical distributions match intended parameters
- Confirmed proper documentation of all methodological steps
